Feature: Abusing kubelet API
  In order to gain full control over the cluster
  As an attacker
  I can use the kubelet API without authentication


  Scenario: Kubelet API exposed to the internet
    Given a cluster, with Kubelet ports exposed to the internet
    And no authentication enabled on Kubelet
    Then the attacker can access access the full API without authentication

    Examples: Data types
      | Secrets           |
      | Nodes             |
      | Containers        |
      | Pods              |
