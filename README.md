# containers-security-project
This project is heavily inspired by [OWASP Cloud Security Project](https://github.com/owasp-cloud-security/owasp-cloud-security). While the cloud security project focus on cloud providers (Azure/AWS/GCP), this projects focus on container orchestrators - Kubernetes, Swarm etc.

The motiviations for this project are:
* Discussing threats and mitigations related to containers orchestrators
* Using threats and mitigation to improve the security of your web applications.

This project is in a very early stage and looking for contributors - feel free to open a PR and contribute relevant threats!
